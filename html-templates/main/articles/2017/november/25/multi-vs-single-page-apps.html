			Advancements in browser JavaScript and the rise of server APIs lay the foundation for Single-Page Applications (SPAs). 
		</p>
	<h1>What is a SPA?</h1>
	<p>
			Traditionally, navigating between web pages would cause rending of a entire page's HTML content on each request.
			More often than not, only part of a page's content is typically changed between each navigations. 
			Inadvertently, and often times... headers, footers, menus, and titles are all re-rendered unnecessarily. 
			So we must ask, why should the entire page reload just to render partial content? 
			SPAs address this concern by using modern browser JavaScript features to perform page modifications (DOM manipulations) on-the-fly. 
			Browser support for asynchronous execution, events, listeners, and HTML imports all make the DOM dynamic and reactive. 
			Modern websites should all use SPA architecture. 
			It just doesn't make sense to use multi-page architectures anymore... 
			With that said, even with the Googles, Facebooks, and Microsofts of the world, SPA is easier said than done... 
			Maintaining speed, state, history, and events is a major programmatic challenge not to be taken lightly. 
			Frameworks have risen to the challenge and offer assistance to the aspiring web developer. 
			Lets all avoid making our own home-cooked JavaScript spaghetti.

	<h1>FRAMEWORK HELL</h1>
		<p>
			With the increased difficulty of building SPAs, frameworks have risen to fill a void. 
			But choose wisely; that snazzy new framework could very well be tomorrow's techincal debt. 
			<br>
			<br>
			There are many to choose from:
			<ul>
				<li>react</li>
				<li>angular</li>
				<li>vue</li>
				<li>ember</li>
				<li>knockout</li>
				<li>polymer</li>
				<li>backbone</li>
				<li>flux</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Has the native browser Web API failed us? 
			When starting this blog project, I was caught in framework hell. 
			Choosing tools that did not employ SPA principles, caused me much headache. 
			Critical to choosing a framework and architecture is thorough understanding of the direction of the modern web. 
			From SSR, CSR, MVC, MVU, MVI, Flux, Redux, SPA, MPA... there are many patterns and architectures to understand. 
			If you don't understand the high-level trade-offs of each technique, architecture, or tool you will succumb to the whim of the next popular buzz-word. 
			<br>
			<br>
			My Current Criteria for Choosing Front-End Framework:
			<ul>
				<li>Single-Page</li>
				<li>Event Driven</li>
				<li>Lightweight</li>
				<li>Reactive</li>
				<li>Data Binding</li>
				<li>URL Routing</li>
				<li>NO Server Rendering</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Component driven architecture is clearly the theme of 2017. 
			For this blog I decided to use <a href='http://vanilla-js.com/' target='_blank'>VanillaJS</a>, an old forgotten framework that's been around since the beginning. 
			While not as snazzy as [<i>insert super awesome new framework</i>], VanillaJS seems to get the job done. 
			VanillaJS allowed me to implement my own simple Web APIs teaching me more than I would have using <i>yesterday's</i> awesome framework. 
			Non-the-less, the challenges of managing state, data, and events in VanillaJS is not simple, and conventions are not concisely defined. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Features to Consider for SPA Implementation using VanillaJS: 
			<ul>
				<li>SEO - Search Engine Optimization</li>
				<li>URL Router - Handling urls, redirects, navigation, and history. See: <a href='http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/deep-dive-into-client-side-routing-navigo-pushstate-hash' target='_blank'>Deep Dive into Client-Side Routing</a></li>
				<li>Event Engine - API for publishing and subscribing to events. See: <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget' target='_blank'>EventTarget API</a></li>
				<li>Data Binding - Binding dynamic data to presentation layer (DOM/HTML). See: <a href=''></a></li>
				<li>Templating - Reusable HTML fragments. See: <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template' target='_blank'>HTML Templates</a>
				<li>Components - Defining Custom HTML Elements, encapsulating both HTML & JavaScript. See: <a href='https://www.webcomponents.org/' target='_blank'>Web Components</a>
			</ul>

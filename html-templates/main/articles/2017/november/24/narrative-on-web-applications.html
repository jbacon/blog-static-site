		While a subject-matter expert in web development could certainly give a better account of the evolution of web apps, 
		building this blog gave me a decent preview into the business. 
		Here is my simple narrative on the evolution of "Modern Web Applications". 
	</p>
	<h2>The Rise of the Static Web</h2>
	<p>
		Looking for an easy solution for publishing content to the web? 
		Static websites are the answer. 
		HTML files typically reside on a machine's file-system ready to be "served" to clients. 
		Special "Server" software assumes the responsibility of shipping these files. 
		Custom code isn't necessary for static HTML files. 
		Traditionally, static sites still require managing machines however. 
		Wouldn't it be great if we could deploy static content to the web without managing messy server boxes? 
		With the rise of Cloud services, this all becomes easier! 
		Forgot about managing machines and configuring servers. 
		Instead, upload static html pages to a Cloud Hosting solution and let them manage everything else. 
	</p>
	<h2>The Rise of Server-Side Rendering</h2>
	<p>
		Along comes data, business logic, and the need for dynamically generated web pages. 
		Server-Side Rendering (SSR) has come to the rescue. 
		<i>We're now officially a web application folks</i>. 
		Web pages need to change with data, and "server" software just won't cut it. 
		There are too many dynamic variables for one-size-fits-all Server software solution. 
		Database connectivity is now a necessity, and that means custom server code. 
		Pages must be dynamically rendered to embed data <i>before</i> serving the final HTML page. 
		Instead of "magical" server <i>software</i> we now write custom code using a "magical" server <i>framework</i>. 
	</p>
	<h2>The Fall of Server-Side Rendering</h2>
	<p>
		Everything changed when browsers advanced... </br>
		JavaScript now allows browsers to make asynchronous calls to servers, without ever refreshing the full page. 
		With SSR a browser will often perform a full page refresh when being served rendered html files. 
		Rendering dynamic content is now a possibility on the client browser, not just the server! 
		Servers can now be broken into two catagories: traditional static content managers and data APIs. 
		SSR takes it's last bow...
	</p>
	<h2>The Rise of Client-Side Rendering</h2>
	<p>
		Static pages make the return to center stage! 
		JavaScript embedded inside a static HTML file is now capable of rendering it's own dynamic content within the browser. 
		Server software is back in action, and SSR frameworks are pushed aside. 
		Client-Side Rendering (CSR) enables the evolution of server APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). 
		Server APIs can focus on delivering just data (usually JSON) to clients instead of rending HTML. 
		Web pages can now integrate with multiple API Servers to be served data from various sources, all while rendering content dynamically. 
		See <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS' target="_blank">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>, 
		a means of integrating various data sources in the browser. 
	</p>
	<h2>The Return of Server-Side Rendering?</h2>
	<p>
		Browsers are doing some heavy lifting running all this JavaScript. 
		Are you noticing long load times, slow web pages, and unresponsive interfaces? 
		Since off-loading their rendering responsiblities, servers have shifted the strain to client devices. 
		Is inefficient JavaScript to blame? 
		Will JavaScript optimizations be enough? 
		Or will the power of the Cloud give SSR the strength to return?

		</br>
		<b>Not likely!</b></br>
		Despite recent efforts to revive SSR frameworks, 
		the sole responsibility of browsers is to display content efficiently, and there's only room for improvements... 
		Browsers are capable of more fluid and reactive interfaces thanks to JavaScript. 
		So long Server-Side Rendering, and don't come back!

		What does this all mean for "Multi-Page" websites? 
		And what is a "Single-Page Application"?

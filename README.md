# Blog Website Static Content

My Blog's public static site files. 
Built entirely as a Single Page Application by altering S3's redirect policy (using some trickery). 
No static site generators were used for these files. 
S3 Static Site Bucket w/ CloudFornt is my current server of choice. 
For development, `docker-compose.yaml` launches a local nginx reverse proxy server instead.
